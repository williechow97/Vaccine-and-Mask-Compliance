# Vaccine-and-Mask-Complicance
In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the infection rates and death rates were extremely high, resulting in hospitals reaching their capacity and medical supplies becoming low. In order to reduce the infection and death rates of Americans, the CDC highly recommended that people wear mask in order to reduce to likelyhood of contracting COVID. With the first vaccines granted Emergency Use Authorization in early 2021, Americans are slowly getting vaccinated, however some people argue that COVID is a hoax and is not as infectious or deadly as the media portrays it to be. These people do not belief in wearing mask to reduce the infection rate of COVID and do not believe in the COVID vaccine.  

Our project aims to explore the relationship between a state's progress with COVID-19 vaccine administration and its citizens' beliefs about mask compliance. We hypothesized that there would be a significant relationship between mask compliance and the progress of vaccinations: states that do comply to mask usage will have higher rates of vaccinations compared to states that don't wear masks. However, through regression models and choropleth maps, we found that this was in fact not true and there isn't a significant relationship between the two.
